Start: 24/05/2021
End: 27/05/2021

Classes will start at 2.00pm (UK time)

Instructor: Jos√© Manuel Aburto

## Course description

The course will present essential methods for demographic analysis with a focus on decomposition techniques. The students will improve their skills in applying these methods in R. 

## Schedule (updated daily)
### Day 1
Origins of Decomposition

Decomposition 1 (Direct vs. compositional)

Kitagawa (1955)

Vaupel and Canudas Romo (2003)

## Course prerequisites
Students should be familiar with basic life table construction. Ideally, students should also have a basic understanding of decomposition methods. It is recommended that students read Preston et al. (2001) Chapters 2-4 prior to the commencement of the course (or an equivalent textbook covering life tables and decomposition). A basic command of R, including data handling, for-loops, and writing basic functions, is a prerequisite.
